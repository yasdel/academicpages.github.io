## Abstract

In the last years, there has been much attention given to the semantic gap problem in
multimedia retrieval systems. Much effort has been devoted to bridge this gap by building
tools for the extraction of high-level, semantics-based features from multimedia content, as
low-level features are not considered useful because they deal primarily with representing
the perceived content rather than the semantics of it. In this paper, we explore a different
point of view by leveraging the gap between low-level and high-level features. We
experiment with a recent approach for movie recommendation that extract low-level Mise-en-
Scéne features from multimedia content and combine it with high-level features provided by
the wisdom of the crowd.
