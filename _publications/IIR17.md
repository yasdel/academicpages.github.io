## Abstract

In this article we propose an interactive Web-based movie recommendation system namely MISRec employing object recognition for movie thumbnails. The proposed system carries out object recognition on movie thumbnails or DVD cover-photos in a real-time manner, and recommends movies based on user’s historical preferences and the query intention. Unlike typical preference-based recommendation sys- tems which provide recommendations merely by using the user’s historical preference, MISRec provides a user with a choice to specify her search intention in a user-friendly and interactive manner and to alter/adjust the recommendation results which in turn can lead to increased utility of recommendation and user satisfaction.
