## Abstract

The goal of this work is to formally provide a general defi- nition of a multimedia recommendation system (MMRS), in particular a content-based MMRS (CB-MMRS), and to shed light on different ap- plications of multimedia content for solving a variety of tasks related to recommendation. We would like to disambiguate the fact that multime- dia recommendation is not only about recommending a particular media type (e.g., music, video), rather there exists a variety of other applica- tions in which the analysis of multimedia input can be usefully exploited to provide recommendations of various kinds of information.
