## Abstract

In this paper, we present an ongoing work that will ultimately result in a movie recommender system based on the Mise-en-Scène characteristics of the movies. We believe that the preferences of users on movies can be well described in terms of the mise-en-scène, i.e., the design aspects of movie making influencing aesthetic and style. Examples of mise-en-scène characteristics are lighting, colors, background, and movements. Our recommender system opens new opportunities in the design of new user interfaces able to offer a personalized way to search for interesting movies through the analysis of film styles rather than using the traditional classifications of movies based on explicit attributes such as genre and cast.
