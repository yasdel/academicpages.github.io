## Abstract

Fairness in recommender systems has been considered with respectto sensitive attributes of users (e.g., gender, race) or items (e.g., revenue in a multistakeholder setting). Regardless, the concept has beencommonly interpreted as some form ofequality– i.e., the degree towhich the system is meeting the information needs of all its usersinan equal sense. In this paper, we argue that fairness in recommendersystems does not necessarily imply equality, but instead it shouldconsider a distribution of resources based on merits and needs. Wepresent a probabilistic framework based on generalized cross entropyto evaluate fairness of recommender systems under this perspective,where we show that the proposed framework is flexible and explana-tory by allowing to incorporate domain knowledge (through an idealfair distribution) that can help to understand which item or user as-pects a recommendation algorithm is over- or under-representing.Results on two real-world datasets show the merits of the proposedevaluation framework both in terms of user and item fairness.
