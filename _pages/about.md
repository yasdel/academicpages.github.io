I am a PhD student in the field of Recommender Systems at the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB) of Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy under supervision of <a href="http://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/people/details/159156">Prof. Paolo Cremonesi</a>. I was a <a href="http://www.cp.jku.at/people/deldjoo/">visiting researcher</a> for six months in the Department of Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz, Austria under supervision of <a href="http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/">Prof. Markus Schedl</a>.

I was also involved in organizing the ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2017 as part of the ACM conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2017).

My PhD topic is on "Video Recommendation by Exploiting Multimedia Content".
