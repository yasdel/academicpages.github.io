<h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>
</header>


<p> I am an assistant professor at <a href="http://www.en.poliba.it/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Polytechnic University of Bari</a> (Politecnico di Bari), Italy, affiliated with the  <a href="http://sisinflab.poliba.it/research/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Information Systems Laboratory (SisInf Lab)</a>, led by <a href="http://sisinflab.poliba.it/dinoia/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Prof. Tommaso di Noia</a>, the head of the group. My research focuses on (i) designing multimodal information-seeking systems (recommender systems, interactive QA and conversational recommender systems), and (ii) designing and evaluating machine learning models to understand their robustness, fairness, generalizability, and interpretability. Recent and ongoing projects consider multimedia recommendation systems, multimodal conversational information-seeking, fairness and biases in recommender systems, adversarial machine learning for the security of recommender systems, and federated learning to maintain user privacy in recommender systems. <br> <br> 


I defended my Ph.D. dissertation, with "con lode" (highest distinction in Italy) in July 2018! I have received two bachelor's degrees one a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Guilan, and the other a B.A. degree in English, Linguistics from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. I completed my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with straight A+ GPA (First Rank) at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden and obtained a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.en.poliba.it/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Polytechnic University of Milan</a> (Politecnico di Milano), Italy. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC"> Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz</a>, Austria for a period of 6 months.<br> <br> 

I am an active member of the recommender systems (RS) community and regularly publish/present tutorials at major venues, such as RecSys, SIGIR, WSDM, and top-tier journals such as ACM Computing surveys (CSUR), UMUAI, IEEE TKDE, and ACM TIST. In the year 2020, I had two surveys accepted at ACM CSUR centered on the topics outlined above. Furthermore, I had the honor to contribute to two book chapters at the 3rd Edition of the RS handbook. I have been involved in organizing ACM Recommender System Challenges as part of the RecSys conference through 2017-2020 (as a chair or advisor). I have also organized two tasks at the MediaEval benchmarking event in 2018 and 2019.
