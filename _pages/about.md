I am currently finalizing my Ph.D. within the field of Computer Science with specialization on Recommender System at Politecnico di Milano under the supervision of <a href="http://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/people/details/159156">Prof. Paolo Cremonesi</a>. During my Ph.D., I was an exchange student at Department of Computational Perception, JKU in Linz, Austria for six months, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/">Prof. Markus Schedl</a>. I was involved in organizing ACM RecSys Challenges 2017 with together with Xing (the European career-oriented social networking company) and RecSys Challenges 2018 with Spotify (the global music, podcast, and video streaming service provider) as part of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.
