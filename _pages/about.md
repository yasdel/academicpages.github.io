<h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>
</header>


<p> I am an assistant professor at  <a href="http://www.en.poliba.it/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Polytechnic University of Bari</a> (Politecnico di Bari), Italy affiliated with the  <a href="http://sisinflab.poliba.it/research/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Information Systems Laboratory (SisInf Lab)</a>, working with <a href="http://sisinflab.poliba.it/dinoia/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Prof. Tommaso di Noia</a>, the head of the group. My main areas of research span a range of topics focusing mainly on recommender systems, multimedia processing, and machine learning. Currently, I am working with a group of Ph.D. students at SisInf Lab on several topics around secuirty, privacy and fairness of recommender systems (see current research topics).<br><br> 

I defended my Ph.D. dissertation, with "con lode" (highest distinction in Italy) in July 2018! I have received a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Guilan, a B.A. degree in English, Linguistics from the University of Gothenburg, an M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.en.poliba.it/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">Polytechnic University of Milan</a> (Politecnico di Milano), Italy. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC"> Â Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz</a>, Austria for 6 months.<br> <br> 

I have published more than 40 papers at top-tier conferences and journals, including ACM Computing Surveys, TKDE, TIST, UMUAI, SIGIR, RecSys, WSDM, CHI, MMSys, AIIA and hold a U.S. Patent. I have been involved in organizing ACM Recommender System Challenges as part of the RecSys conference through the years 2017-2020 (as a chair or advisor). I have also organized two tasks at the MediaEval benchmarking event in 2018 and 2019.
